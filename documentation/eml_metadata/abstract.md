Biodiversity studies could strongly benefit from three dimensional data on ecosystem structure derived from contemporary remote sensing technologies, such as Light Detection and Ranging  (LiDAR). Despite the increasing availability of such data at regional and national scales, the average ecologist has been limited in accessing them due to high requirements on computing power and remote-sensing knowledge. We processed Denmark’s publicly available national Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) dataset acquired in 2014/15 together with the accompanying elevation model to compute rasterized descriptors of interest for ecological studies. With a grain size of 10 m, these data products provide a snapshot of high-resolution measures including vegetation height, structure and density, as well as topographic descriptors including elevation, aspect, slope and wetness across more than forty thousand square kilometers covering almost all of Denmark’s terrestrial surface. The resulting dataset is comparatively small (~87 GB, compressed 16.4 GB) and the raster data can be readily integrated into analytical workflows in software familiar to many ecologists (GIS software, R, Python). Source code and documentation for the processing workflow are openly available via a code repository, allowing for transfer to other ALS datasets, as well as modification or re-calculation of future instances of Denmark’s national ALS dataset. We hope that our high-resolution ecological vegetation and terrain descriptors (EcoDes-DK15) will serve as an inspiration for the publication of further such datasets covering other countries and regions and that our rasterized dataset will provide a baseline of the ecosystem structure for current and future studies of biodiversity, within Denmark and beyond.
